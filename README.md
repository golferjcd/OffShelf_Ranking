# Off Shelf Promotion Ranking Model
#### The goal of this model is to effectively quantify and optimize revenue from premium product placement in retail grocery stores. The premium placement refers to “end caps” or shelves/gondolas located at the end of the normal fixtures within the grocery store. These areas tend to attract more attention and the products placed in these areas tend to have a higher rate of sales then when they are placed in the normal position on the shelf. Because these areas within the stores are scarce, it is essential to be able to systematically select the products for these areas that will result in the most revenue. 
# Assumptions
#### The following assumptions were made when developing this model
####1.	All historical data is accurate, offers were executed as indicated by historical records
####2.	All store space/fixture data is accurate
####3.	Ranking analysis is done on a regular cadence, 8 weeks prior to in-store sales dates
